This is my personal blog, A Nerd's Word, available at http://www.a-nerds-word.com.

It's based on [this](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-build-a-react-and-gatsby-powered-blog-in-about-10-minutes-625c35c06481) tutorial using Gatsby, React.js and GraphQL.

Any personally taken images are hosted on Amazon S3, while the app itself is hosted on Heroku.

I'll be using this to post about my various interests, such as Magic: The Gathering and scifi/fantasy literature.
