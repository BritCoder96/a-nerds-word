#This is my personal blog, A Nerd's Word.

It's based on [this](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-build-a-react-and-gatsby-powered-blog-in-about-10-minutes-625c35c06481) tutorial using Gatsby and GraphQL.

I'll be using this to post about my various interests, such as Magic: The Gathering and scifi/fantasy literature.
