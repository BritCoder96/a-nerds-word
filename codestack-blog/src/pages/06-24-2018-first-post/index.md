Hi! My name's Bryan, and this is my blog. I'll put a bit of an overview of what I'll be doing here in this first post.

I'll be using this blog to post about some of the things I love - namely, board games, Magic: The Gathering, anime, and sci-fi/fantasy literature and tv/movies.

Some posts will end up being reviews of books/shows/movies/games/cards I really enjoyed, while others will be a more general description of something really interesting that I discovered or accomplished.

I'm also currently working on my first novel, and once I'm nearing publication (hopefully soon), I'll be posting more about the journey.

As with most blogs, you can use the tags to look for related content.

Thanks so much for visiting, and welcome to A Nerd's Word.
