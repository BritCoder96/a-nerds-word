Welcome back, and happy new year!!

I welcomed in the new year in a foreign country for the first time in my life for 2019. Birthright was a wonderful experience for me, and I really enjoyed it. Here's some highlights:

I got to experience a connection to my Jewish heritage in a new way at the Western Wall:

I got to float in the Dead Sea:

I got to put on some healing mud from the lowest point on Earth:

I got to hike up Masada and visit an ancient Roman fort on the top of a mountain:

I got to ride a camel in the desert:

There were a bunch of other experiences that were meaningful to me, including visiting the Israeli Holocaust Museum. That's something that I think everyone should visit at some point, either in Israel or in the States (there's one in D.C.). It's an extremely emotional, harrowing experience, and it really gives an entirely different perspective into one of the darkest points in recent human history, one that you can't get just from a textbook.

Anyway, on a happier note, I'll be going to SCG Worcester next weekend to visit some of my friends from college I haven't seen since I graduated and play some competitive magic, so I'll see you then!

Till next time,
