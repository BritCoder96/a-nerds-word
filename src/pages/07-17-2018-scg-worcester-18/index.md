Hello everyone! So this past weekend, I went to the StarCity Games Worcester Open! It was my first major Magic: the Gathering tournament, and I had a blast. With my new legacy deck (B/R Reanimator, for those of you who haven't seen my [previous post](https://www.a-nerds-word.com/reanimator) about it). The event was team constructed, so I partnered with two of my friends, with one of them playing standard (mono red) and the other playing a rather unique modern deck, superfriends (planeswalker tribal). There were nine rounds on day one. Given that I was pretty new to legacy, that our standard player had only played mono red a couple of times, and the fact that superfriends isn't exactly a well known modern deck for a reason, we ended up going 2-3 and dropping round five. We had a lot of fun though, and I got a good feel for what it's like to play legacy on a competitive level.

For participation in the team event, the three of us each recieved one of these three playmats for free:

I got the one in the middle, since it was my favorite art out of the three. I'm pretty happy with it, since it's a stright upgrade from my previous playmat, which was kind of dreary.

After we'd dropped out of the main event, the three of us did a bunch of side events. I did three two-headed giant sealed events, going 2-1-1 in the first one and 3-1 in the second (the third was late into day 2, and we dropped after losing the first three matches). The 2-1-1 record was interesting, since we ended up tying a game due to this card:

Usually, this card is pretty bad, but in two-headed giant, where there are two teams of two facing off against each other, all players lose all their life simultaniously, causing an immediate draw. That round our opponent ended up playing it against us and we went to time. Ironically, I pulled one in the next event, and I almost needed to play it when I had four cards left in my library. Luckily for me, my opponent decked himself first!

I ended up pulling some decent value in the packs I opened between the sealed events and the prizes, including the third and fourth most expensive cards in the set (Tezzeret and Resplendent Angel, at roughly $18 each). I also ended up pulling some of the cards I was looking for, including [Death Baron](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=447226) for my zombie deck and several others for my artifact deck.

I also was able to sell a bunch of my bulk to one of the vendors at the event, and was able to secure the third and final badlands for my legacy deck, which I'm super happy about.

Overall, it was an amazing weekend. I met a lot of great people, got to hang out with friends I hadn't seen in a while, and got great experience playing legacy. I'm looking forward to the next big event! See you next time!
