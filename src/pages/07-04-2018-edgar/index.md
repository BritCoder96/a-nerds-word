Hey everyone! So today, as promised last week, I'll be talking about my Edgar Markov EDH deck, the one that I bought that badlands for. The decklist is [here](https://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/30-06-17-i-vant-to-suck-your-blood/) for those who are interested.

Vampire tribal was one of the first decks I ever played. I traded an old custom RC car I had lying in my basement for a red/black vampire 60 card casual deck and an esper artifact deck when I first got into magic. To this day, my vampire tribal deck and my artifact tribal deck (now both EDH and much improved) are still two of my favorite decks.

I went through several iterations for vampires, including having [Olivia Voldaren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=247235) as a voltron (commander damage) commander. But when they released [Edgar Markov](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Edgar%20Markov), an explosively aggreessive mardu vampire commander, I knew I needed to rebuild the deck. Olivia was red/black, but wasn't really on theme for the deck. Edgar, on the other hand, let me run several very good, white vampires, and was much more of a vampire tribal commander.

Since I built the deck, I've tuned it, and have played it with reasonable levels of success at local competitive tournaments in NYC. It's a great deck to play.

See you next time!
