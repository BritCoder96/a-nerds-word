So today, a very expensive piece of paper arrived in the mail - A Badlands from the Magic: The Gathering set Revised.\n\n![My new (used) Badlands](https://s3.amazonaws.com/a-nerds-word/Badlands.jpg \"My new (used) Revised Badlands.\")\n\nFor those of you who don't know, Magic sets are released every few months, with the first, Alpha, having been released on August 5, 1993. The set this particular card comes from, Revised, was released less than a year afterwards, in April 1994. There were an lot of really good cards in those sets, as well as a lot of pretty bad ones. What makes some of these cards so expensive, though, is that they're part of the [reserved list](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/official-reprint-policy-2010-03-10). What this means is that, for legal reasons created after an outcry by collectors, every card on the list can never be reprinted in paper form.\n\nDue to supply and demand, the cards on that list, especially the good ones, are very expensive, and will continue to go up in price for the forseeable future. Which brings me back to my Badlands. Badlands is a land that lets you produce mana, which in Magic allows you to cast spells and activate abilities. These spells and abilities are essential to playing the game. They usually cost specific combinations of mana in any of the five colors (White, Blue, Black, Red, and Green), to cast, meaning you'll need to produce mana of these colors in order to cast them. Most lands can only be used (tapped) for one color; these are called basics. Many others tap for more than one color, but these have downsides; for example, shocklands, which are considered fairly strong cards, cause you to lose two life when they enter untapped; otherwise, they enter tapped. You can only use lands for mana when they're untapped, so that's pretty relevant.\n\nThe one exception to this rule are dual lands. These lands, only printed in a few of the earliest sets of Magic, before the reserved list was created (Alpha, Beta, Unlimited, and Revised), tap for one of two colors upon entering untapped, with zero downside. This may not seem that strong, but it essentially makes them the best lands that tap for two colors in existence. Add in the fact that they're all on the reserved list, but can still be played in competitive formats, and that makes them very expensive. I bought my Badlands on Ebay for $166; the median price at TCGPlayer.com (one of the go-to websites for Magic: The Gathering card pricing) as of this afternoon was $312.79, so I got mine for quite a steal.\n\nSince these cards are in high demand but perpetually short supply, due to the reserved list, most Magic players agree that their price will continue to go up for the forseeable future. For me, this was a good investment, since over time, the card will continue to increase in value. In the meantime, I will run it in one of my favorite Commander decks, a vampire tribal deck with Edgar Markov as the commander. To learn more about what commander is (it's my favorite format of Magic to play), read this [article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/ways-play/introduction-commander-2016-10-28). I'll make a blog post about my Edgar deck sometime next week, along with the decklist, so stay tuned if you want to know more.\n\nThat's all for now! See you soon :)",

I bought my Badlands on Ebay for $166; the median price at TCGPlayer.com (one of the go-to websites for Magic: The Gathering card pricing) as of this afternoon was $312.79, so I got mine for quite a steal.\n\nSince these cards are in high demand but perpetually short supply, due to the reserved list, most Magic players agree that their price will continue to go up for the forseeable future. For me, this was a good investment, since over time, the card will continue to increase in value. In the meantime, I will run it in one of my favorite Commander decks, a vampire tribal deck with Edgar Markov as the commander. To learn more about what commander is (it's my favorite format of Magic to play), read this [article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/ways-play/introduction-commander-2016-10-28). I'll make a blog post about my Edgar deck sometime next week, along with the decklist, so stay tuned if you want to know more.\n\nThat's all for now! See you soon :)",

So today, I decided to make my entrance into a new format of Magic for me: Legacy.\n\nLegacy is a sixty-card Magic format that lies on the scale of expensive decks between Modern and Vintage. Modern includes cards from [this](https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/formats/modern) list of sets - from Mirrodin to the current set. Because of this wider selection of cards available, modern is a lot more expensive than standard, which is only the last few most recent sets. [Legacy](https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/formats/legacy), on the other hand, has every card in Magic available, with a banlist of cards that aren't allowed. This means that you can play cards that are much older and more expensive; for example, the dual lands I mentioned in my last post. [Vintage](https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/formats/vintage), finally, has every card available, and no banlist, except for a few cards that are restricted - you can only run one of each in a deck instead of the usual four.\n\nNow, I've been looking into getting into a more competitive format for a while. At first, I looked at modern, and had a lot of fun with a proxied [affinity](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/archetype/modern-affinity-46460#paper) deck. The problem, though, was that the deck costs roughly $1000, with the downside that the cards can be reprinted; they're not on the reserved list.\n\nLast night, I was looking at events coming up that I could play a modern deck at and meet up with some of my friends from college. We noticed that there was an [event](http://www.starcitygames.com/events/140718_worcester_fact_sheet.html) in Worcester, MA in two weeks. This was both nearby several of my friends, and had the added benefit of being a team format - each team of three has a standard, a modern, and a legacy player. One of my friends wanted to play modern, the other wanted to play standard. I also wanted to play modern, so we considered asking some more of our friends to start another team. But then I started looking at legacy decks and found reanimator.\n\n[Reanimator](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/testing-legacy-b-r-reanimator/) is a legacy deck that wins by putting a [Griselbrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=239995) into your graveyard, and then reanimating it onto the battlefield turn one. Then you have a 7/7 flying lifelink on the field, and an additional 14 cards in hand. If that ends up working, you've probably got a decent chance of winning the game.\n\nThe deck is more expensive than Affinity, mostly due to the dual lands. I already had a Badlands, though, and I realized that I could get the deck for much cheaper if I borrowed or traded for a few of the cards and replaced some others with ones I already owned.\n\nAs of now, I have all of the cards in the deck available to me, for a fraction of the price, and will go up to Worcester two weeks from now to participate in my first major tournament.

So today, as promised last week, I'll be talking about my Edgar Markov EDH deck, the one that I bought that badlands for. The decklist is [here](https://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/30-06-17-i-vant-to-suck-your-blood/) for those who are interested.\n\nVampire tribal was one of the first decks I ever played. I traded an old custom RC car I had lying in my basement for a red/black vampire 60 card casual deck and an esper artifact deck when I first got into magic. To this day, my vampire tribal deck and my artifact tribal deck (now both EDH and much improved) are still two of my favorite decks.\n\nI went through several iterations for vampires, including having [Olivia Voldaren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=247235) as a voltron (commander damage) commander. But when they released [Edgar Markov](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Edgar%20Markov), an explosively aggreessive mardu vampire commander, I knew I needed to rebuild the deck. Olivia was red/black, but wasn't really on theme for the deck. Edgar, on the other hand, let me run several very good, white vampires, and was much more of a vampire tribal commander.\n\nSince I built the deck, I've tuned it, and have played it with reasonable levels of success at local competitive tournaments in NYC. It's a great deck to play.\n\nSee you next time!",

The decklist is [here](https://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/30-06-17-i-vant-to-suck-your-blood/) for those who are interested.\n\nVampire tribal was one of the first decks I ever played. I traded an old custom RC car I had lying in my basement for a red/black vampire 60 card casual deck and an esper artifact deck when I first got into magic. To this day, my vampire tribal deck and my artifact tribal deck (now both EDH and much improved) are still two of my favorite decks.\n\nI went through several iterations for vampires, including having [Olivia Voldaren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=247235) as a voltron (commander damage) commander. But when they released [Edgar Markov](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Edgar%20Markov), an explosively aggreessive mardu vampire commander, I knew I needed to rebuild the deck. Olivia was red/black, but wasn't really on theme for the deck. Edgar, on the other hand, let me run several very good, white vampires, and was much more of a vampire tribal commander.\n\nSince I built the deck, I've tuned it, and have played it with reasonable levels of success at local competitive tournaments in NYC. It's a great deck to play.\n\nSee you next time!",

So this past weekend, I went to the StarCity Games Worcester Open! It was my first major Magic: the Gathering tournament, and I had a blast. With my new legacy deck (B/R Reanimator, for those of you who haven't seen my [previous post](https://www.a-nerds-word.com/reanimator) about it). The event was team constructed, so I partnered with two of my friends, with one of them playing standard (mono red) and the other playing a rather unique modern deck, superfriends (planeswalker tribal). There were nine rounds on day one. Given that I was pretty new to legacy, that our standard player had only played mono red a couple of times, and the fact that superfriends isn't exactly a well known modern deck for a reason, we ended up going 2-3 and dropping round five. We had a lot of fun though, and I got a good feel for what it's like to play legacy on a competitive level.\n\nFor participation in the team event, the three of us each recieved one of these three playmats for free:\n\n![alt text](https://s3.amazonaws.com/a-nerds-word/plamats.png \"Playmats\")\n\nI got the one in the middle, since it was my favorite art out of the three. I'm pretty happy with it, since it's a stright upgrade from my previous playmat, which was kind of dreary.\n\nAfter we'd dropped out of the main event, the three of us did a bunch of side events. I did three two-headed giant sealed events, going 2-1-1 in the first one and 3-1 in the second (the third was late into day 2, and we dropped after losing the first three matches). The 2-1-1 record was interesting, since we ended up tying a game due to this card:\n\n![alt text](https://s3.amazonaws.com/a-nerds-word/fraying_omnipotence.jpeg \"Fraying Omnipotence\")\n\nUsually, this card is pretty bad, but in two-headed giant, where there are two teams of two facing off against each other, all players lose all their life simultaniously, causing an immediate draw. That round our opponent ended up playing it against us and we went to time. Ironically, I pulled one in the next event, and I almost needed to play it when I had four cards left in my library. Luckily for me, my opponent decked himself first!\n\nI ended up pulling some decent value in the packs I opened between the sealed events and the prizes, including the third and fourth most expensive cards in the set (Tezzeret and Resplendent Angel, at roughly $18 each). I also ended up pulling some of the cards I was looking for, including [Death Baron](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=447226) for my zombie deck and several others for my artifact deck.\n\nI also was able to sell a bunch of my bulk to one of the vendors at the event, and was able to secure the third and final badlands for my legacy deck, which I'm super happy about.\n\nOverall, it was an amazing weekend. I met a lot of great people, got to hang out with friends I hadn't seen in a while, and got great experience playing legacy. I'm looking forward to the next big event! See you next time!",

The event was team constructed, so I partnered with two of my friends, with one of them playing standard (mono red) and the other playing a rather unique modern deck, superfriends (planeswalker tribal). There were nine rounds on day one. Given that I was pretty new to legacy, that our standard player had only played mono red a couple of times, and the fact that superfriends isn't exactly a well known modern deck for a reason, we ended up going 2-3 and dropping round five. We had a lot of fun though, and I got a good feel for what it's like to play legacy on a competitive level.\n\nFor participation in the team event, the three of us each recieved one of these three playmats for free:\n\n![alt text](https://s3.amazonaws.com/a-nerds-word/plamats.png \"Playmats\")\n\nI got the one in the middle, since it was my favorite art out of the three. I'm pretty happy with it, since it's a stright upgrade from my previous playmat, which was kind of dreary.\n\nAfter we'd dropped out of the main event, the three of us did a bunch of side events. I did three two-headed giant sealed events, going 2-1-1 in the first one and 3-1 in the second (the third was late into day 2, and we dropped after losing the first three matches). The 2-1-1 record was interesting, since we ended up tying a game due to this card:\n\n![alt text](https://s3.amazonaws.com/a-nerds-word/fraying_omnipotence.jpeg \"Fraying Omnipotence\")\n\nUsually, this card is pretty bad, but in two-headed giant, where there are two teams of two facing off against each other, all players lose all their life simultaniously, causing an immediate draw. That round our opponent ended up playing it against us and we went to time. Ironically, I pulled one in the next event, and I almost needed to play it when I had four cards left in my library. Luckily for me, my opponent decked himself first!\n\nI ended up pulling some decent value in the packs I opened between the sealed events and the prizes, including the third and fourth most expensive cards in the set (Tezzeret and Resplendent Angel, at roughly $18 each). I also ended up pulling some of the cards I was looking for, including [Death Baron](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=447226) for my zombie deck and several others for my artifact deck.\n\nI also was able to sell a bunch of my bulk to one of the vendors at the event, and was able to secure the third and final badlands for my legacy deck, which I'm super happy about.\n\nOverall, it was an amazing weekend. I met a lot of great people, got to hang out with friends I hadn't seen in a while, and got great experience playing legacy. I'm looking forward to the next big event! See you next time!",

So today I'm making two posts, one about another of my favorite book series, and another about one of my favorite animes!\n\nFirst up is the books series, called *The Stormlight Archive*, by Brandon Sanderson. The first book in the series is *The Way of Kings* (pictured above).\n\nThese books are pretty long, in the roughly thousand page range for each book, just letting you know. That said, these books are fantastic. Brandon Sanderson is one of my favorite authors, mainly because he is a master of worldbuilding. He's created multiple fantasy worlds in his various book series, and each of them is as believable as our own. He invents entire cultures, countries, religions, foods, and magic systems that are wholly unique. \n\nIn the Stormlight Archive books, people from various nations in the planet of Roshar are brought together for various reasons, and they each bring exactly the kind of diverse perspectives you'd expect if people from wildly diffrent cultures were brought together for the first time in our world. They share stories and burdens, and each character is vibrant and lively. \n\nA little bit of a plot synopsis, without any spoilers: One of several point of view characters, Kaladin is a surgeon's-son-turned-solider who has unfortunate circumstances befall him on the battlefield.

So today I'm making two posts, one about another of my favorite book series, and another about one of my favorite animes!\n\nFirst up is the books series, called *The Stormlight Archive*, by Brandon Sanderson. The first book in the series is *The Way of Kings* (pictured above).\n\nThese books are pretty long, in the roughly thousand page range for each book, just letting you know. That said, these books are fantastic. Brandon Sanderson is one of my favorite authors, mainly because he is a master of worldbuilding. He's created multiple fantasy worlds in his various book series, and each of them is as believable as our own. He invents entire cultures, countries, religions, foods, and magic systems that are wholly unique. \n\nIn the Stormlight Archive books, people from various nations in the planet of Roshar are brought together for various reasons, and they each bring exactly the kind of diverse perspectives you'd expect if people from wildly diffrent cultures were brought together for the first time in our world. They share stories and burdens, and each character is vibrant and lively. \n\nA little bit of a plot synopsis, without any spoilers: One of several point of view characters, Kaladin is a surgeon's-son-turned-solider who has unfortunate circumstances befall him on the battlefield. There are other POV chararcters as well, from all walks of life, such as Shallan, a young noblewoman from a house that has fallen into hard times, attempting to learn from a famous scholar in a neighboring country; and Dalinar, a member of one of the royal families on Roshar, who is beset by the harships from his haunting past and the future of his nation.\n\nIn the midst of all of these characters are the spren, spirit-like creatures who pop up everywhere. They're associated with many things, including emotions such as anger or fear, but also rain, life, and other concepts of reality. These spren are taken for granted as part of life, but they serve a much more important role later on.\n\nIn addition to the spren are the shards, a combination of extremely rare armor and weapons that are relics from a forgotten age. Only great nobles and royalty have access to them. They grant enormous strength, and will heal themselves with time. Shardblades can only be used by their owner, and can be summoned at any time with a ten second delay. In addtion, shardblades can cut through any material, and when they touch a living being, they instantly kill then, ripping the souls from their bodies. \n\nIn most (but not all) of the nations on Roshar, individuals with light eyes (blue, green, etc.) are nobles, while those with dark eyes are commoners. It is said, however, that owning a shard will turn a darkeyes into a lighteyes, thereby turning a commoner into nobility...\n\nAnyway, I would *highly* recommend these books. Sanderson weaves words and worlds in ways that few authors can. I'll probably recommend some more of his work in the future, so stay tuned!\n\nTill next time!\n\n-- Bryan",

As promised, I'm posting again today, this time with one of my favorite animes, *Re:Creators*! It's my first post here about anime, so here goes :)\n\nAnime is one of those things that gets a bad rep a lot of the time. Some of the often-used tropes (fan service, I'm looking at you) I really don't like, and honestly I think the medium would be a lot better without them. *That said*, anime is a medium that involves lots of amazing stories as well as mediocre ones, just like any other form of storytelling. I personally like fantasy and sci-fi animes, but I do enjoy the occasional slice of life anime (*Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid*, for example).\n\nOne of the subgenres of anime, and stories in general, is something called isekai (in Japanese, this translates to 'another world'). As you can probably tell from the name, isekai involve characters moving from one world to another, usually between the real world and a fantasy world. There are lots of stories like this, in every medium (for example, *The Matrix* falls under this category, along with *Sword Art Online*, which is another of my favorite shows/book series and will be the topic of its own future post).\n\nThere's just something magical about the idea of leaving our mundane lives and going to someplace extraordinary. Just like the idea of flying, it's something that's been a dream of humans for a long time; one could even argue that something like *The Odyssey* falls in that category, and that was written thousands of years ago!\n\nIn any event, Re:Creators is a kind of **reverse** isekai: instead of the main character, an ordinary seventeen year old guy named Sota, going to an alternate world, the alternate world(s) *come to him*.\n\nThe first episode begins with an unknown girl commiting suicide by train, which sets an interesting tone for the story. You don't learn more about her until much later, but, suffice to say, she's important. After that, you meet Sota, who's super into anime, but who also strives to create his own. In some of the opening scenes, you see him open his computer and try to draw in graphic design software, before giving up due to artist's block, and going to watch some anime to clear his head.\n\nBefore I talk about the **important thing** that happens next, I want to comment on the animation style of Re:Creators, which is fantastic. In scenes involving computer screens, the level of detail for both the screen itself and its contents is **stunning**. Seriously, there is an **insane** attention to detail in *Re:Creators*, and it's one of the things I love about it. Take a look at this screenshot:\n\n![alt text](https://s3.amazonaws.com/a-nerds-word/recreators_detail.png \"Look at that detail!!\")\n\nAnyway, upon turning on his tablet to watch an episode of one of his favorite shows, *Elemental Symphony of Vogelchevalier*, he gets sucked into the anime, where he is protected from an assailent by the main character of that anime, Selesia Upitiria. A moment later, they are both sucked back into Sota's room back on Earth, where, needless to say, both of them are a bit surprised. Selesia is the first **creation** you meet in *Re:creators*, although you meet several more later. You also end up meeting the **creators** of these characters, the artists and writers who made their characters so believable that they **literally came to life**.\n\n*Re:Creators* gives a rare glimpse into the lives and work of the people who create the stories we love, and it offers a wonderful philosophical question on what makes us people, and the beauty of creation. The creations come from a variety of genres, and this gives the show a diversity of experiences that makes it really interesting. \n\nI loved this anime, for its animation, its wonderful characters, its perspective into the oft-forgotten creators of stories and its unique idea of a reverse isekai.\n\nI've watched it twice, and am planning on watching it for a third time at some point.\n\nAnyway, that's all for now! Stay tuned for more nerdy reviews and comments!\n\n-- Bryan",

Rakuen is an RPG built in RPGMaker, the video game creation tool that was used to build *To the Moon* and *Finding Paradise*, which I've written about before. \n\nUnlike *To the Moon*, which is almost entirely story based, with very few gamelike elements, Rakuen involves various puzzles and quests throughout the game, making it more like an RPG, following the namesake of the platform it was built with.\n\nThat said, *Rakuen* has a rich story, just like *To the Moon*. You play for most of the game as a sick child in a hospital, whose mother introduces him to Rakuen, a children's book about a fantasy world called Morizora’s Forest. She says the world is real, and that you can get to it through doors hidden inside the hospital. After meeting a few of the doctors, patients, and volunteers in the hospital, you gain access to hidden hallways that lead you to the world of Morizora’s Forest.\n\nYou spend a decent chunk of the game in both the hospital and the forest, trying to complete the five main story quests. These quests consist of resolving the conflicts or emotional trauma of the people you meet in the hospital, who each have parallels in Morizora's Forest. In resolving these quests, you not only play as the boy, but also as each of the characters themselves, reliving their memories and helping them find closure.\n\nThere are also darker events that are hinted at throughout the game, if you read various newspaper clippings or journal entries that are hidden in lockers or on the floor and walls of hallways. The game references the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, and several in-game events are directly influenced by it.\n\nThe game also makes references to other games, including a green mushroom who complains about a mustachioed man trying to eat it for an 'extra life', referencing the Mario franchise, and a painting of an man and a woman dancing next to a lighthouse, referencing *To the Moon*.\n\nAlthough most of the game has a whimsical, childlike feel, there are emotional events and deep, meaningful messages as well. The game deals with death, guilt, depression, loneliness, alchoholism, and the incredible grief of losing loved ones before their time. I personally was almost moved to tears twice near the end of the game, which I consider a hallmark of a well-written story. If you can make the observer of a story so enamored with your characters that when something ill befalls them, the observer is moved to tears, you've probably done a good job.\n\nOne more note: The music in the game is also very, very good, although personally I preferred the music in *To the Moon* a bit better.\n\nAnyway, if you want an RPG with a moving story and impactful characters, I would highly recommend *Rakuen*. It's also only $6 on Steam right now, so it's a pretty good deal too :)\n\nThat's all for today!\n\n-- Bryan ",

Today, I'll be talking about Grand Prix Providence, another major magic event I participated in over the weekend.\n\n![alt text](https://s3.amazonaws.com/a-nerds-word/gp_providence.jpg \"GP Providence\")\n\nGP Providence is similar to SCG Worcester, which I talked about a while back, but this time around, the main event was standard. I don't play standard, so I decided to go do side events instead. Several of my friends were going to do the main event, and one of them was giving me a ride to and from the event, so I figured I'd use the opportunity to go and visit some people I hadn't seen in a while.\n\nOn a side note, I accepted a job offer a couple of weeks ago, and I will be starting work as a software engineer on September 4th! I'm really excited to start my career, and I figured I should take the time to visit with friends who live further away before I get swamped with work.\n\nAnyway, the event was a great experience. I did two draft events Friday night, and then played in a commander event on Saturday. Each event comes with a promo land and tix you can spend on things in the prize wall, depending on how you do in the event (for reference, 10 tix equals one $4 standard pack). I was planning on doing another event after that one, but the last round of commander went to time (it was a three way tie, so we all split an extra 60 tix!).\n\nAfter the commander event, I grabbed a delicious lunch at Angelo's Civita Farnese (shoutout to one of the owners, Jamie, who chatted with me while I waited for my custom-order pizza). I'd definitely recommend the place for a good, quick bite to eat nearby the convention center.\n\nOne of my friends who I hadn't seen in a long time ended up attending the event unexpectedly (she moved away a few years ago, so it was great to see her there), so after lunch we ended up playing a bunch of magic together since we were both done with events. We played a bit of modern, and then played pack wars with the prize packs I got from my tix. For reference, pack wars is essentially a quick, rather silly format, where your deck consists of only the cards in a single pack and you have access to unlimited mana.\n\nAnother good note about the event: I ended up trading a bunch of bulk in my binder for the last roughly $70 of my legacy deck, so it's official: I now own 100% of R/B Reanimator!\n\nAnyway, I had a blast at the event, and while none of my friends made day two of the main event, it was awesome hanging out with them and playing some good old-fashioned magic.\n\nSee you next time!\n\n-- Bryan\n",

So I'm going to start with the most recent one I really enjoyed, and go back from there.\n\nThe Broken Earth trilogy starts with [The Fifth Season](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00H25FCSQ/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1), by N. K. Jemisin. All three books in the trilogy won the Hugo Award (the highest honor in science fiction literature, for those of you who don't know) for best novel for their respective years of publication, and for me, at least, those awards were well deserved.\n\nThe raw emotions in the series are incredibly intense, and I have to say, these books are not for the faint of heart. A lot of terrible things happen to the main characters, so if you're looking for a cheery set of books, look elsewhere.\n\nHowever, if you're looking for a *good* set of books, pick these up. The worldbuilding alone is excellent, and so is everything else.\n\nThe trilogy takes place on an earth-like planet called The Stillness, in which for thousands of years, major earthquakes have distrupted the progress of civilization, causing what is known as a Fifth Season every few decades. These seasons are devastating, wiping out whole communities and making survival difficult at best - not unlike the classic example of a nuclear winter, except caused by earthquake-induced ash clouds and acid rain instead.\n\nOne of the only reasons humanity has survived for so long in this kind of situation is the existance of people called orogenes. Orogenes have the ability to draw in  ambient energy to control the earth. In doing so, they create a torus, an area around them which usually becomes very cold, very fast due to the sudden lack of heat. They're universally hated by most people, mainly because they can just as easily cause an earthquake as stop one.\n\nIn order to keep the peace, orogenes are rounded up and taken to The Fulcrum, where they act as what could be considered well-treated slaves who are sent out to try and prevent Fifth Seasons, and to stop any other earth-related problems around the Stillness.\n\nThere's much more to the plot than that, and there's a lot I can't cover, including about the main character, due to spoilers.\n\nThe writing in these books is sublime, but also surprisingly unique. The books take place in the present tense, which is rare enough as it is, but they also employ the first, second, and third person voices at various points. This is something I've almost never seen before, and yet Jemisin does it masterfully. It's a breath of fresh air from the regular style of writing you often see in fantasy.\n\nAnyway, that's my book review for today. I hope you enjoyed it, and see you next time!\n\n*Edit: Corrected on 08/21/2018 - This post previously stated that only the first book in the trilogy recieved the Hugo award for best novel; in fact, all three novels in the trilogy won best novel for their respective years of publication.*",
