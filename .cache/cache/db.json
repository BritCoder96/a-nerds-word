Which brings me back to my Badlands. Badlands is a land that lets you produce mana, which in Magic allows you to cast spells and activate abilities. These spells and abilities are essential to playing the game. They usually cost specific combinations of mana in any of the five colors (White, Blue, Black, Red, and Green), to cast, meaning you'll need to produce mana of these colors in order to cast them. Most lands can only be used (tapped) for one color; these are called basics. Many others tap for more than one color, but these have downsides; for example, shocklands, which are considered fairly strong cards, cause you to lose two life when they enter untapped; otherwise, they enter tapped. You can only use lands for mana when they're untapped, so that's pretty relevant.","position":{"start":{"line":14,"column":1,"offset":1061},"end":{"line":14,"column":942,"offset":2002},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":14,"column":1,"offset":1061},"end":{"line":14,"column":942,"offset":2002},"indent":[]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"The one exception to this rule are dual lands.

It's been a long time since I last updated this blog (about a year and a half, in fact!) A lot has happened in that time. I'll cover some of it here and some of it in later blog posts, but to start it off I've rebranded the blog a bit! I'm now using my author name, Bradley Woods, and linking to that account instead, because guess what: I've published my first novel, <em>Unbounded</em>!</p>\n<p>I've mentioned that I've been working on it a few times now, and a little while ago, it was finally released:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://bradleywoodsauthor.github.io/images/unbounded.jpg\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"The cover of my new novel, Unbounded!\"></p>\n<p>I've worked really hard on this, and you can read it <a href=\"http://amazon.com/dp/B0873YKZ5J\">here</a>!</p>\n<p>A quick synopsis: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Everyone dreams of being able to fly. What if you could have that power, and fame and riches to go with it? Would you take it? Even if it came at a terrible cost?</p>\n<p>With only a thousand born per generation, Fliers have been revered in human society for millennia. They are provided with every comfort and offered highly-paid positions of power. That power, though, has a catch. All Fliers die before they turn 40 years old.></p>\n<p>In 2036, teenagers Lindsey Tescher and Derek Stalden have lived in luxury ever since they were revealed to be Fliers several years ago. But just before their high school graduation, they uncover a dark secret that challenges everything they thought they knew about the worldâ€™s Fliers. To survive the consequences of their discovery, they must journey far from home and endure harrowing hardship, unraveling painful secrets of the past. And in the process, their struggle to find the truth of who Fliers really are might just change the course of history.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm also working on my second novel, which is a separate story from <em>Unbounded</em>. Writing one novel has really taught me a ton about how to turn an idea into a polished book. Hint: it involved a <strong>lot</strong> of editing. Seriously, if you think your first, second, or third draft is good enough, read it again or get a beta reader, because you will need a lot of edits before you're done. Nothing's perfect, but the more you write, the better your writing gets. You'd be amazed at the things a beta reader might catch that you as the author would miss, and every time that happens, another writing tip gets added to your toolbox the next time you sit down to write. </p>\n<p>My toolbox still has plenty of room to grow, but it's fuller than it's ever been. I've honed my skills, and this next book is going to be even better.</p>\n<p>Of course, not all is well in the world. Between the last time I wrote a post and now, this guy reared its ugly head:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.minnpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/coronavirusCDC640.png?w=640&#x26;strip=all\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"Coronavirus\"></p>\n<p>I'm not going to say too much on this, because let's be frank, the novel Coronavirus is all that's in the news these days, but needless to say it's been devastating to so many and is still running rampant throughout the USA and in many other parts of the world. I'm lucky enough to be relatively safe and sound, but being isolated from friends and family has been tough. Still, as far as global pandemics and recessions are concerned, I'm doing pretty well. My heart goes out to everyone effected by this thing. Let's work hard to beat it together. Wear a mask and social distance, people. If you can save even one life by doing so, you've done good.</p>\n<p>I have more content coming soon, including looking forward to the new <em>Dresden Files</em> book, Brandon Sanderson having lectures on writing for free on YouTube, and a whole host of other stuff I've missed.

In the first one, I partnered with a student who was new to the magic club at WPI, and went 2-2. In the second event, I partnered with my friend Andrew, and went 3-1. I had a lot of fun building and playing those decks, and it was great meeting the new students!</p>\n<p>I also got a chance to practice playing my black-red reanimator legacy deck in paper for the first time in a while. I played a few rounds against a few current students, both against legacy death's shadow, where I was able to force my way through three couterspells with one more reanimation spell than they could handle.</p>\n<p>In the final event I played in, I did a one round legacy turbo event, where I was paired against mono-red burn.

For those of you who don't know, Birthright is a thing where people from the USA with Jewish Heritage get to go to Israel for 7-10 days for free!

This season of anime is wrapping up, and I've gotta say, this has been a good one. Here's my current ranking of shows I've seen this season (ranking stuff is hard, so I'll rank these into Tiers 1, 2 and 3):</p>\n<p>Tier 1: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bloom into You - This is the first Yuri anime I've ever watched, and while I was hesitant to try it, it's actually surprisingly really good! The characters are super interesting, and the romances seem natural. Plus, one of the main characters is a writer, and I can definitely empathise with that :)</li>\n<li>Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai - This is another one that I was hesitant to try, since the title and the cover art looked like they were just more anime harem nonsense. But the show is actually insanely well-written, and the main character and the girl he's in a committed relationship with have some of the best interactions and dialogue I've ever seen.</li>\n<li>Sword Art Online Season 3: Alicization - Others might call me out on this, but I love SAO. I think it's a truly awesome story, with really interesting characters and worldbuilding, and those who think otherwise will not sway my opinion. I've actually read all the novels the show is based on (the latest one came out today, and I'm super psyched about it), and the source material is really good too. Plus, the animation for the new season is gorgeous.</li>\n<li>RWBY Volume 6 - Even though RWBY isn't technically an anime, I'm listing it here anyway because it takes large amounts of inspiration from anime, and because it's soooo good. I can't say much since this is the sixth season, but I love this show so much.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Tier 2:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Zombieland Saga: This show is really great, I wasn't quite sure whether to put this in tier 1 or 2, since it's kind of on the border. I can't really say much about this, other than that it's really good and you just need to watch it cold without any information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Tier 3: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime: This show is a normal isekai anime, solidly okay, but nothing amazing. It's decent.</li>\n<li>Fairy Tail Final Season - I enjoy Fairy Tail a decent amount, but mostly as a guilty pleasure. For me at least, it sort of goes from really good to really bad in terms of quality.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Anyway, that's my update for me. When you hear from me next, I'll probably have just gotten back from the Middle East!</p>\n<p>Happy Holidays, and see you next time!</p>\n<p>-- Bradley</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-4c5b712c37ecc8177c0350b7a69c2d32--","value":"<hr>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/a-nerds-word/psycho_pass.jpg\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"Psycho Pass\"></p>\n<p>Welcome back! I know it's been a while since I last posted. I've been super busy with work, for the most part, but I've also been working on a couple of other side projects, which I'd like to make a bit of an announcement here about. First, my debut novel has been sent out to my second round of beta readers, and I'm hoping to send it to publishers within the next few months.</p>\n<p>On top of that, I started work on my second novel at the end of September, and I finished the first draft a couple of days ago! I'm really pysched about it, and it's certainly been keeping me busy on my commute to work :)</p>\n<p>Anyway, today's blog post is about a cyberpunk dystopian anime called Psycho Pass. It's fairly well known in the anime community, but I only got around to watching it over the last few weeks.</p>\n<p>The basic premise is that, in the 2100s, the world is ruled by an overseeing body called the Sibyl System. Every person's brain is contantly scanned for their Psycho Pass, which is a score that determines how likely you are to commit a crime in the future. The Sibyl system also judges what profession a person will take up after graduating high school, as well as a myriad of other decisions, leaving a kind of utopia of luxury where the citizens don't have anything to worry about.</p>\n<p>Of course, like most of these shows, things aren't as great as they seem. There are still crimes that occur, and people who are determined by Sibyl to be latent criminals are brutally imprisoned or murdered by the police, lest they commit actual crimes in the future. The show mainly follows Akane Tsunemori, a fresh-faced police officer who doesn't quite approve of how things are done. The police force, which is severely understaffed due to the influence of Sibyl, is made up of inspectors, who have a clear psycho pass, and enforcers, who are latent criminals but have been deemed proficient for the job by the system.</p>\n<p>Akane is an inspector, and it soon becomes clear to her that Sibyl isn't the perfect system that everyone seems to think it is.</p>\n<p>I won't say anything more about the plot due to spoilers, but what I can say is that this show is fantastic. It really shows the way people tend to think with the flock and get used to comfort, despite obvious downsides. The characters are interesting and believable, and like any good cop show, the suspense keeps you on your toes.</p>\n<p>That said, the show is very dark, and, while animated, extremely violent. Many people die in horrifying, gruesome ways, so if that isn't your cup of tea, this show isn't for you.</p>\n<p>If you can stomach it, though, I would highly recommend Psycho Pass. It's a thought-provoking show that really gets your heart pumping.</p>\n<p>That's all for now! See you next time!</p>\n<p>-- Bradley</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-8242d798c4c9b03a80b649ee2737299e--","value":"<hr>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/a-nerds-word/kingkiller_chronicle.jpg\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"The Kingkiller Chronicle Books\"></p>\n<p>Welcome back! Just a quick note before I begin today's post: I've started work (Just finished my second week), and have a long commute, so for now I'll only be posting once a week, on Saturdays or Sundays. Once I get an apartment closer to work, I'll have more time and can post more, but until then I'll be posting weekly.</p>\n<p>Anyway, today's post is about another one of my favorie books series: <em>The Kingkiller Chronicle</em>, by Patrick Rothfuss. <em>The Kingkiller Chronicle</em> follows the story of Kvothe, a young mage, bard, warrior, and overall legend. Each book in the trilogy (currently only two of the three have been released, in addition to a novella and a short story or two) begins and ends with Kvothe several years in the future from when the main story takes place, where he is in hiding and posing as a inkeeper in a small village. There are also interludes that go back to the inn, so the story is very much the 'story within a story' type of deal.</p>\n<p>The writing in these books is some of the most beautiful writing I've ever seen. Rothfuss weaves together sentences that seem like poetry, except they are integral parts of wonderful epic fantasy novel. The prolouges and epilogues each consist of a <em>a silence of three parts</em>. These sections are wonderful prose, and I'm going to put a passage here from the last of the silences in the prologue of the first book, <em>The Name of the Wind</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>The third silence was not an easy thing to notice. If you listened for an hour, you might begin to feel it in the wooden floor underfoot and in the rough, splintering barrels behind the bar. It was in the weight of the black stone hearth that held the heat of a long dead fire. It was in the slow back and forth of a white linen cloth rubbing along the grain of the bar. And it was in the hands of the man who stood there, polishing a stretch of mahogany that already gleamed in the lamplight. The man had true-red hair, red as flame. His eyes were dark and distant, and he moved with the subtle certainty that comes from knowing many things. The Waystone was his, just as the third silence was his. This was appropriate, as it was the greatest silence of the three, wrapping the others inside itself. It was deep and wide as autumn's ending. It was heavy as a great riversmooth stone. It was the patient, cut-flower sound of a man who is waiting to die.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That passage gives me chills every time I read it, and I've read <em>The Name of the Wind</em> three timees.</p>\n<p>Now, that's not to say the books are completely written in that flowery prose. There's plenty of action, dialogue, and humor - which  not to say that those parts aren't beautifully written either, they're just different.</p>\n<p>The second book in trilogy is <em>A Wise Man's Fear</em>, and the novella, from the perspective of an mentally ill young woman named Auri, is called <em>The Slow Regard of Silent Things</em>. I'd highly recommend all of these if you like epic fantasy.</p>\n<p>Anyway, that's all for now. See you next week!</p>\n<p>-- Bradley</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-d3a01cb827ac90a699806ccda4c29221--","value":"<hr>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/a-nerds-word/grimgar.jpg\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash\"></p>\n<p>Hi again! Today's post is about a bit of a lesser-known anime that came out in 2016 called <em>Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash</em>. While it's techically an Isekai anime, since it involves people from our world visiting another, vastly different world, the Isekai elements are more of a small, infrequently mentioned backdrop to the story. The show takes place on a world called Grimgar, where the main character, Haruhiro, along with a group of other men and woman around his own age, find themselves in with no memory of their previous lives besides their names and vague, fading pieces of knowledge from the modern world. Grimgar is your typical fantasy world, with goblins and kobalds as low level monsters, and various classes that soldiers can become, such as priests, thieves, or hunters.</p>\n<p>Haruhiro joins a party with some of the other people who appeared in Grimgar with him. He trains to become a thief, while Manato, the party's leader, becomes a priest (essentially the party's healer, like a cleric in DnD). The other members of Haruhiro's party are Ranta, a curly haired, obstinate black knight; Moguzo, a large, muscular soldier who, despite his size, is quiet and kind; Shihoru, a quiet, timid mage; and Yume, a tall, confident hunter with a wild streak.</p>\n<p>There are three main reasons I really like Grimgar. While the plot is relatively slow, the show is incredibly character focused. It follows the party as they try to survive in their new environment, and they grow as a result. More characters are added later, and they also have great character development, especially a certain character that I can't really mention for fear of spoilers. Yume is clumsy at first, both as a hunter and how she acts. She often says the wrong thing, but she grows wiser and more careful throughout the show, without losing her bold, carefree spirit. Haruhiro learns to become a better leading member in the party, and grows more confident in his ability to help them succeed. Ranta, who is pretty annoying for most of the show, shows that he does, in fact, care about the other members of the party.</p>\n<p>The show has its fare share of heartbreak and sorrow, along wtith great joy. It deals strongly with how people deal with loss in different ways (it's a major theme of the show), and will probably make you tear up, at least a little.</p>\n<p>Grimgar also has a beautiful, unique animation style: the characters are in high-definition, modern animation (which is still gorgeous), while the background is in a less-detalied watercolor style. It takes a bit to get used to, but once you do, it really looks good. </p>\n<p>The last, but not least, thing I really like about Grimgar is the music. To be fair, I've been listening to a lot of J-pop recently, but the Grimgar music is good enough that I bought the music from iTunes and imported them to Spotify to listen to on the train to work (btw, I had my first week of full-time software engineer work today, and it went really well!).</p>\n<p>For example, here's one of the songs from the show:</p>\n<iframe width=\"290\" height=\"195\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mMnHdDdAyKM\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>The piano intro is what really gets me. I, at least, think it's quite good.</p>\n<p>Anyway, that's all for now - I'd highly recommend Grimgar if you like character-driven fantasy stories.

The main character, Violet, was an orpan who was trained from a young age to be a soldier. Once the war ended, she needs to integrate into the now peaceful world, but finds that the no-nonsense, unemotional, militaristic way she was raised isn't exactly ideal during peacetime. She manages to find a job, thanks to one of the officers she knew in the army, as an Auto Memory Doll - someone who writes letters for citizens who can't read or write themselves.</p>\n<p>At first, she struggles. While her technical ability to write is excellent, her letters are short and blunt, with none of the emotion and thoughtfulness that goes into a meaningful letter. However, throughout the show, and through her interaction between both her co-workers and her clients, Violent slowly, painfully learns what it's like to be human, and what it's like to be loved.</p>\n<p>The show itself has some of the most beautiful animation and music I've seen in any show ever, and the period dress of the early 1900s is fascinating, albeit not entirely accurate. The show also invented their own languange, which is fascinating when you take into account that typewriters are prevelant in the show, where you can see the language in action.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I'd highly recommend Violet Evergarden for people who want to feel all the feels. It came out earlier this year, and is available on Neflix.</p>\n<p>That's it for now!

Today, I'll be talking about another anime I recently watched, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/MADE-IN-ABYSS-Season-1/dp/B073S2612X\"><em>Made in Abyss</em></a>. It's a fantasy anime set in a small town that surrounds the <strong>Abyss</strong> - a colossal hole in the ground that is so deep that no one has made it to the bottom and returned alive. There's a pretty good reason for this: every time you ascend from the Abyss, even by a few meters, you get sick, and the effects worsen significantly the further down you go before ascending, eventually leading to hallucinations, severe internal bleeding, loss of humanity, and finally, death. To top it all off, the Abyss is crowded with extremely dangerous, primeval creatures to whom a human is a small, midafternoon snack.</p>\n<p>You're probably wondering why anyone in their right mind would want to go down there, right? Well, the Abyss is filled with powerful relics from an ancient, techologically advanced civilization, and the collection of these artifacts makes the town surrounding the Abyss thrive. It's a major tourist attraction, and the cave divers that find the relics and bring them back provide the town with a thriving economy.</p>\n<p>The main character of the show is Riko, a 12-year-old orphan girl and budding cave diver who one day, while searching the relatively safe upper layer of the Abyss for relics, runs into what appears to be a robot with the appearance of a boy about her age. Without going into too much detail, the two befriend each other, and soon thereafter go on a quest to reach to bottom of the Abyss, knowing that they will never bet able to return (There's a pretty good reason to do this for both of them, but I'm not going to spoil it).</p>\n<p>If the words 'never be able to return' sound ominous, it's because the show is far darker than it appears. Mixed in with the whimisical exploration and childlike, Studio Ghibli-eque wonder of the Abyss are harrowing, deeply moving scenes that betray the fact that the Abyss will have mercy on no one, not even a couple of kids.</p>\n<p>I personally loved the show, which won Crunchyroll's Anime of the Year award for 2017, in part because Riko is a believable character. She acts pretty much exactly how an overly intelligent 12-year-old would, which makes the show all the more potent when misfortune befalls her. The show also has wonderful music and beautiful animation, and I'd recommend it to anyone. The next season of the show has been confirmed, and I can't wait for it to come out!</p>\n<p>That's all for today! See you next time!</p>\n<p>-- Bradley</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-3c698e9b4a648a6cb264869a9c09c79b--","value":"<hr>\n<p>Hi again everyone! Today, I'll be talking about Grand Prix Providence, another major magic event I participated in over the weekend.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/a-nerds-word/gp_providence.jpg\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"GP Providence\"></p>\n<p>GP Providence is similar to SCG Worcester, which I talked about a while back, but this time around, the main event was standard. I don't play standard, so I decided to go do side events instead. Several of my friends were going to do the main event, and one of them was giving me a ride to and from the event, so I figured I'd use the opportunity to go and visit some people I hadn't seen in a while.</p>\n<p>On a side note, I accepted a job offer a couple of weeks ago, and I will be starting work as a software engineer on September 4th! I'm really excited to start my career, and I figured I should take the time to visit with friends who live further away before I get swamped with work.</p>\n<p>Anyway, the event was a great experience. I did two draft events Friday night, and then played in a commander event on Saturday. Each event comes with a promo land and tix you can spend on things in the prize wall, depending on how you do in the event (for reference, 10 tix equals one $4 standard pack). I was planning on doing another event after that one, but the last round of commander went to time (it was a three way tie, so we all split an extra 60 tix!).</p>\n<p>After the commander event, I grabbed a delicious lunch at Angelo's Civita Farnese (shoutout to one of the owners, Jamie, who chatted with me while I waited for my custom-order pizza). I'd definitely recommend the place for a good, quick bite to eat nearby the convention center.</p>\n<p>One of my friends who I hadn't seen in a long time ended up attending the event unexpectedly (she moved away a few years ago, so it was great to see her there), so after lunch we ended up playing a bunch of magic together since we were both done with events. We played a bit of modern, and then played pack wars with the prize packs I got from my tix. For reference, pack wars is essentially a quick, rather silly format, where your deck consists of only the cards in a single pack and you have access to unlimited mana.</p>\n<p>Another good note about the event: I ended up trading a bunch of bulk in my binder for the last roughly $70 of my legacy deck, so it's official: I now own 100% of R/B Reanimator!</p>\n<p>Anyway, I had a blast at the event, and while none of my friends made day two of the main event, it was awesome hanging out with them and playing some good old-fashioned magic.</p>\n<p>See you next time!</p>\n<p>-- Bradley</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-b66fec96b5f3d1c15dc33d4dc52324b7--","value":"<hr>\n<p>Hello there!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/a-nerds-word/rakuen.jpg\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"Rakuen\"></p>\n<p>Today's topic of discussion is a fantastic video game I recently played, <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/559210/Rakuen/\"><em>Rakuen</em></a>. Rakuen is an RPG built in RPGMaker, the video game creation tool that was used to build <em>To the Moon</em> and <em>Finding Paradise</em>, which I've written about before. </p>\n<p>Unlike <em>To the Moon</em>, which is almost entirely story based, with very few gamelike elements, Rakuen involves various puzzles and quests throughout the game, making it more like an RPG, following the namesake of the platform it was built with.</p>\n<p>That said, <em>Rakuen</em> has a rich story, just like <em>To the Moon</em>. You play for most of the game as a sick child in a hospital, whose mother introduces him to Rakuen, a children's book about a fantasy world called Morizoraâ€™s Forest. She says the world is real, and that you can get to it through doors hidden inside the hospital. After meeting a few of the doctors, patients, and volunteers in the hospital, you gain access to hidden hallways that lead you to the world of Morizoraâ€™s Forest.</p>\n<p>You spend a decent chunk of the game in both the hospital and the forest, trying to complete the five main story quests. These quests consist of resolving the conflicts or emotional trauma of the people you meet in the hospital, who each have parallels in Morizora's Forest. In resolving these quests, you not only play as the boy, but also as each of the characters themselves, reliving their memories and helping them find closure.</p>\n<p>There are also darker events that are hinted at throughout the game, if you read various newspaper clippings or journal entries that are hidden in lockers or on the floor and walls of hallways. The game references the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, and several in-game events are directly influenced by it.</p>\n<p>The game also makes references to other games, including a green mushroom who complains about a mustachioed man trying to eat it for an 'extra life', referencing the Mario franchise, and a painting of an man and a woman dancing next to a lighthouse, referencing <em>To the Moon</em>.</p>\n<p>Although most of the game has a whimsical, childlike feel, there are emotional events and deep, meaningful messages as well. The game deals with death, guilt, depression, loneliness, alchoholism, and the incredible grief of losing loved ones before their time. I personally was almost moved to tears twice near the end of the game, which I consider a hallmark of a well-written story. If you can make the observer of a story so enamored with your characters that when something ill befalls them, the observer is moved to tears, you've probably done a good job.</p>\n<p>One more note: The music in the game is also very, very good, although personally I preferred the music in <em>To the Moon</em> a bit better.</p>\n<p>Anyway, if you want an RPG with a moving story and impactful characters, I would highly recommend <em>Rakuen</em>. It's also only $6 on Steam right now, so it's a pretty good deal too :)</p>\n<p>That's all for today!</p>\n<p>-- Bradley </p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-99496751d6454223c2ef264d12e99d65--","value":"<hr>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/a-nerds-word/mistborn.jpg\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"Mistborn\"></p>\n<p>Hi again! Going off of yesterday's post about <em>The Stormlight Archive</em>, today I'll be writing a review of another one of Brandon Sanderson's series, <em>Mistborn</em>. </p>\n<p>The Mistborn books are much shorter than the Stormlight Archive books (roughly 500 pages each), but there are more of them. There's actually two separate trilogies currently set in the Mistborn world, and there are more incoming.</p>\n<p>The first trilogy takes place in a world where most of the population are essentially starving slaves, called skaa, ruled over by a wealthy aristocracy, and, more imporantly, an immortal supreme emperor. Ash constantly falls from the sky, and at the start of the first novel, things are getting so bad that it is becoming difficult to survive oustide of cities.</p>\n<p>Some people in this world have the ability to use magic, but the ability is hereditary; only nobles can use it. </p>\n<p>The magic system is pretty unique: there are different types of metals that, when ingested by someone who can use them (called an allomancer), they can use the ability for that specific metal. Most allomancers can only use one metal, and therefore are given nicknames associated with the metal they can use. For example, Coinshots can use steel when ingested to push off of metal; essentially allowing them to fly by pushing off of coins. It works by basic physics: you're pushing your weight against the weight of the coin, and so to push more weight, you need more weight on the other side in return. Every metal has an opposite metal. For example, Lurchers can pull on iron, doing the opposite of Coinshots.</p>\n<p>A few rare allomancers, however, can use every metal, as long as they ingest it. That's where two of the main characters of the books come in -  Vin, a street urchin who doesn't realize that she's an allomancer, and Kelsier, a half-skaa thief who finds her and develops a bold plan: to take down the emperor himself.</p>\n<p>There are many other interesting characters in these books; mostly the thief crew itself, but also various nobles (some of whom are intergral to the plot).</p>\n<p>These books are really good, especially if you're looking for a distopian epic fantasy, with a unique magic system, that takes the traditional hero's journey story and tells it from a strong female perspective. </p>\n<p>One more thing - without giving too much away, the second trilogy takes place in the same world as Mistborn, but in more modern times, with technology equivilant to the roaring twenties in our world.</p>\n<p>That's all for today. See you next time!</p>\n<p>-- Bradley</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-406f69c7fd25151a5b6b8c82a124bb48--","value":"<hr>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/a-nerds-word/recreators.jpg\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"Re:Creators\"></p>\n<p>Hi again! As promised, I'm posting again today, this time with one of my favorite animes, <em>Re:Creators</em>! It's my first post here about anime, so here goes :)</p>\n<p>Anime is one of those things that gets a bad rep a lot of the time. Some of the often-used tropes (fan service, I'm looking at you) I really don't like, and honestly I think the medium would be a lot better without them. <em>That said</em>, anime is a medium that involves lots of amazing stories as well as mediocre ones, just like any other form of storytelling. I personally like fantasy and sci-fi animes, but I do enjoy the occasional slice of life anime (<em>Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid</em>, for example).</p>\n<p>One of the subgenres of anime, and stories in general, is something called isekai (in Japanese, this translates to 'another world'). As you can probably tell from the name, isekai involve characters moving from one world to another, usually between the real world and a fantasy world. There are lots of stories like this, in every medium (for example, <em>The Matrix</em> falls under this category, along with <em>Sword Art Online</em>, which is another of my favorite shows/book series and will be the topic of its own future post).</p>\n<p>There's just something magical about the idea of leaving our mundane lives and going to someplace extraordinary. Just like the idea of flying, it's something that's been a dream of humans for a long time; one could even argue that something like <em>The Odyssey</em> falls in that category, and that was written thousands of years ago!</p>\n<p>In any event, Re:Creators is a kind of <strong>reverse</strong> isekai: instead of the main character, an ordinary seventeen year old guy named Sota, going to an alternate world, the alternate world(s) <em>come to him</em>.</p>\n<p>The first episode begins with an unknown girl commiting suicide by train, which sets an interesting tone for the story. You don't learn more about her until much later, but, suffice to say, she's important. After that, you meet Sota, who's super into anime, but who also strives to create his own. In some of the opening scenes, you see him open his computer and try to draw in graphic design software, before giving up due to artist's block, and going to watch some anime to clear his head.</p>\n<p>Before I talk about the <strong>important thing</strong> that happens next, I want to comment on the animation style of Re:Creators, which is fantastic. In scenes involving computer screens, the level of detail for both the screen itself and its contents is <strong>stunning</strong>. Seriously, there is an <strong>insane</strong> attention to detail in <em>Re:Creators</em>, and it's one of the things I love about it. Take a look at this screenshot:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/a-nerds-word/recreators_detail.png\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"Look at that detail!!\"></p>\n<p>Anyway, upon turning on his tablet to watch an episode of one of his favorite shows, <em>Elemental Symphony of Vogelchevalier</em>, he gets sucked into the anime, where he is protected from an assailent by the main character of that anime, Selesia Upitiria. A moment later, they are both sucked back into Sota's room back on Earth, where, needless to say, both of them are a bit surprised. Selesia is the first <strong>creation</strong> you meet in <em>Re:creators</em>, although you meet several more later. You also end up meeting the <strong>creators</strong> of these characters, the artists and writers who made their characters so believable that they <strong>literally came to life</strong>.</p>\n<p><em>Re:Creators</em> gives a rare glimpse into the lives and work of the people who create the stories we love, and it offers a wonderful philosophical question on what makes us people, and the beauty of creation. The creations come from a variety of genres, and this gives the show a diversity of experiences that makes it really interesting. </p>\n<p>I loved this anime, for its animation, its wonderful characters, its perspective into the oft-forgotten creators of stories and its unique idea of a reverse isekai.</p>\n<p>I've watched it twice, and am planning on watching it for a third time at some point.</p>\n<p>Anyway, that's all for now! Stay tuned for more nerdy reviews and comments!</p>\n<p>-- Bradley</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-a5d35dc0fa4deb09889388785db1b2bf--","value":"<hr>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/a-nerds-word/TheWayOfKings.png\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"The Way of Kings\"></p>\n<p>Hello! So today I'm making two posts, one about another of my favorite book series, and another about one of my favorite animes!</p>\n<p>First up is the books series, called <em>The Stormlight Archive</em>, by Brandon Sanderson. The first book in the series is <em>The Way of Kings</em> (pictured above).</p>\n<p>These books are pretty long, in the roughly thousand page range for each book, just letting you know. That said, these books are fantastic. Brandon Sanderson is one of my favorite authors, mainly because he is a master of worldbuilding. He's created multiple fantasy worlds in his various book series, and each of them is as believable as our own. He invents entire cultures, countries, religions, foods, and magic systems that are wholly unique. </p>\n<p>In the Stormlight Archive books, people from various nations in the planet of Roshar are brought together for various reasons, and they each bring exactly the kind of diverse perspectives you'd expect if people from wildly diffrent cultures were brought together for the first time in our world. They share stories and burdens, and each character is vibrant and lively. </p>\n<p>A little bit of a plot synopsis, without any spoilers: One of several point of view characters, Kaladin is a surgeon's-son-turned-solider who has unfortunate circumstances befall him on the battlefield. There are other POV chararcters as well, from all walks of life, such as Shallan, a young noblewoman from a house that has fallen into hard times, attempting to learn from a famous scholar in a neighboring country; and Dalinar, a member of one of the royal families on Roshar, who is beset by the harships from his haunting past and the future of his nation.</p>\n<p>In the midst of all of these characters are the spren, spirit-like creatures who pop up everywhere. They're associated with many things, including emotions such as anger or fear, but also rain, life, and other concepts of reality. These spren are taken for granted as part of life, but they serve a much more important role later on.</p>\n<p>In addition to the spren are the shards, a combination of extremely rare armor and weapons that are relics from a forgotten age. Only great nobles and royalty have access to them. They grant enormous strength, and will heal themselves with time. Shardblades can only be used by their owner, and can be summoned at any time with a ten second delay. In addtion, shardblades can cut through any material, and when they touch a living being, they instantly kill then, ripping the souls from their bodies. </p>\n<p>In most (but not all) of the nations on Roshar, individuals with light eyes (blue, green, etc.) are nobles, while those with dark eyes are commoners. It is said, however, that owning a shard will turn a darkeyes into a lighteyes, thereby turning a commoner into nobility...</p>\n<p>Anyway, I would <em>highly</em> recommend these books. Sanderson weaves words and worlds in ways that few authors can. I'll probably recommend some more of his work in the future, so stay tuned!</p>\n<p>Till next time!</p>\n<p>-- Bradley</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-a6e1f7f5c8d9932902ccc002611143ef--","value":"<hr>\n<p>Welcome back!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/a-nerds-word/to_the_moon.jpg\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"To the Moon\"></p>\n<p>Today I'm going to talk a bit about two of my favorite video games: <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/206440/To_the_Moon/\">To the Moon</a> and its sequel, <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/337340/Finding_Paradise/\">Finding Paradise</a>.</p>\n<p>They're essentially interactive stories. There aren't very many traditional gameplay elements, apart from a few minigames, but that hardly matters. What makes these games special is the magnificant way they blend music, art, and dialogue into a story that can make a grown man cry.</p>\n<p>In both games, you play as two scientists, Dr. Watts and Dr. Rosaline, who work for a company known a Sigmund Corp. Sigmund's services are rather unique: they help people on their deathbeds pass away peacefully by going into their memories and modifying them to fulfill their dying wishes.</p>\n<p>The games progess as you first meet the family of the patient, and then traverse through their memories to see what needs changing and how to do so. In the process, you learn the patient's entire life story, from their early childhood to their twilight years. You learn how they became to be the person slowing dying in front of you: their loves, their losses, and everything in between. Without spoiling anything, this makes the finale for both games all the more heartbreaking.</p>\n<p>The serious nature of the games is broken up with brilliant dialogue from the two protagonists. Dr. Watts is silly at times, but truly cares about the patient. Dr. Rosaline often is annoyed at Watts' antics, but plays along when she feels nessecary. The two make an interesting duo, and their interactions add a much-needed lighthearted element to the games. There are also a large number of references to popular culture within both games, making the experience even more amusing.</p>\n<p>The art style for the games is 8-bit, but the sprites offer a surprisingly large amount of expression for such a limited canvas, which makes the art all the more impressive.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/a-nerds-word/to_the_moon_in_game.jpg\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"To the Moon - In Game Art\"></p>\n<p>Last but not least, one of the shining elements of the game is the music. It's whimsically woven into the plot, and adds gravity to scenes that need it and levity to those that don't. The music for most of both games is instrumental, but there is a twist to the style in the closing moments of both games that really drives the finale to the truly sublime.</p>\n<p>I would heartily recommend both games, as well as the holiday specials that accompany them, to anyone who loves a brilliant story. The games are only around five hours to play through each, so they're not a huge time commitment either.</p>\n<p>Anyway, that's all for now.</p>\n<p>See you next time!</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-0e39973968795e197ee9477fd3359fcf--","value":"<hr>\n<p>Hello everyone! So this past weekend, I went to the StarCity Games Worcester Open! It was my first major Magic: the Gathering tournament, and I had a blast. With my new legacy deck (B/R Reanimator, for those of you who haven't seen my <a href=\"https://www.a-nerds-word.com/reanimator\">previous post</a> about it). The event was team constructed, so I partnered with two of my friends, with one of them playing standard (mono red) and the other playing a rather unique modern deck, superfriends (planeswalker tribal). There were nine rounds on day one. Given that I was pretty new to legacy, that our standard player had only played mono red a couple of times, and the fact that superfriends isn't exactly a well known modern deck for a reason, we ended up going 2-3 and dropping round five. We had a lot of fun though, and I got a good feel for what it's like to play legacy on a competitive level.</p>\n<p>For participation in the team event, the three of us each recieved one of these three playmats for free:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/a-nerds-word/plamats.png\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"Playmats\"></p>\n<p>I got the one in the middle, since it was my favorite art out of the three. I'm pretty happy with it, since it's a stright upgrade from my previous playmat, which was kind of dreary.</p>\n<p>After we'd dropped out of the main event, the three of us did a bunch of side events. I did three two-headed giant sealed events, going 2-1-1 in the first one and 3-1 in the second (the third was late into day 2, and we dropped after losing the first three matches). The 2-1-1 record was interesting, since we ended up tying a game due to this card:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/a-nerds-word/fraying_omnipotence.jpeg\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"Fraying Omnipotence\"></p>\n<p>Usually, this card is pretty bad, but in two-headed giant, where there are two teams of two facing off against each other, all players lose all their life simultaniously, causing an immediate draw. That round our opponent ended up playing it against us and we went to time. Ironically, I pulled one in the next event, and I almost needed to play it when I had four cards left in my library. Luckily for me, my opponent decked himself first!</p>\n<p>I ended up pulling some decent value in the packs I opened between the sealed events and the prizes, including the third and fourth most expensive cards in the set (Tezzeret and Resplendent Angel, at roughly $18 each). I also ended up pulling some of the cards I was looking for, including <a href=\"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=447226\">Death Baron</a> for my zombie deck and several others for my artifact deck.</p>\n<p>I also was able to sell a bunch of my bulk to one of the vendors at the event, and was able to secure the third and final badlands for my legacy deck, which I'm super happy about.</p>\n<p>Overall, it was an amazing weekend. I met a lot of great people, got to hang out with friends I hadn't seen in a while, and got great experience playing legacy. I'm looking forward to the next big event!

So today I'm going to take a break from Magic to talk about one of my favorite long-running book series: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dresden_Files\">The Dresden Files</a>. The Dresden Files are an urban fantasy series revolving around Harry Dresden: a wizard turned private eye living in modern day Chicago.</p>\n<p>There's two main things I love about this series: the worldbuilding/variety of fantasy elements, and the character development.</p>\n<p>There are a very large number of fantasy creatures in the Dresden Files: vampires (white, red and black), the Fae (including pixies, goblins and the Winter and Summer queens and ladies), werewolves, and a plethora of others. These races are introduced throughout the books (of which there are currently fifteen), and are provided more in-depth character development as time goes on. Each race has a variety of customs, cultures, and political structures. It's a pretty complex fictional universe, especially given that the books take place in a major modern day city.</p>\n<p>The character development in the books is also pretty impressive. There are several minor characters in the first few books that, later on, become major characters and forces to be reckoned with in their own rights. Waldo Butters is a medical examiner who loves polka and helps patch up Harry when he gets injured in battle. Later in the series, he becomes much more relevant, and develops into an interesting character who overcomes many of the weaknesses he had early on. The same can be said of many of the other minor characters, including a pack of college-age werewolves and a worn out cop who occasionaly works with Dresden on cases.</p>\n<p>These books are pretty quick reads, but highly enjoyable. I've read the whole series three times, and each one only took me a few days - I enjoyed them so much I couldn't put them down.</p>\n<p>That's all for now!

I traded an old custom RC car I had lying in my basement for a red/black vampire 60 card casual deck and an esper artifact deck when I first got into magic. To this day, my vampire tribal deck and my artifact tribal deck (now both EDH and much improved) are still two of my favorite decks.</p>\n<p>I went through several iterations for vampires, including having <a href=\"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=247235\">Olivia Voldaren</a> as a voltron (commander damage) commander. But when they released <a href=\"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Edgar%20Markov\">Edgar Markov</a>, an explosively aggreessive mardu vampire commander, I knew I needed to rebuild the deck. Olivia was red/black, but wasn't really on theme for the deck. Edgar, on the other hand, let me run several very good, white vampires, and was much more of a vampire tribal commander.</p>\n<p>Since I built the deck, I've tuned it, and have played it with reasonable levels of success at local competitive tournaments in NYC.

So today, I decided to make my entrance into a new format of Magic for me: Legacy.</p>\n<p>Legacy is a sixty-card Magic format that lies on the scale of expensive decks between Modern and Vintage. Modern includes cards from <a href=\"https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/formats/modern\">this</a> list of sets - from Mirrodin to the current set. Because of this wider selection of cards available, modern is a lot more expensive than standard, which is only the last few most recent sets. <a href=\"https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/formats/legacy\">Legacy</a>, on the other hand, has every card in Magic available, with a banlist of cards that aren't allowed. This means that you can play cards that are much older and more expensive; for example, the dual lands I mentioned in my last post. <a href=\"https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/formats/vintage\">Vintage</a>, finally, has every card available, and no banlist, except for a few cards that are restricted - you can only run one of each in a deck instead of the usual four.</p>\n<p>Now, I've been looking into getting into a more competitive format for a while. At first, I looked at modern, and had a lot of fun with a proxied <a href=\"https://www.mtggoldfish.com/archetype/modern-affinity-46460#paper\">affinity</a> deck. The problem, though, was that the deck costs roughly $1000, with the downside that the cards can be reprinted; they're not on the reserved list.</p>\n<p>Last night, I was looking at events coming up that I could play a modern deck at and meet up with some of my friends from college. We noticed that there was an <a href=\"http://www.starcitygames.com/events/140718_worcester_fact_sheet.html\">event</a> in Worcester, MA in two weeks. This was both nearby several of my friends, and had the added benefit of being a team format - each team of three has a standard, a modern, and a legacy player. One of my friends wanted to play modern, the other wanted to play standard. I also wanted to play modern, so we considered asking some more of our friends to start another team. But then I started looking at legacy decks and found reanimator.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/testing-legacy-b-r-reanimator/\">Reanimator</a> is a legacy deck that wins by putting a <a href=\"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=239995\">Griselbrand</a> into your graveyard, and then reanimating it onto the battlefield turn one. Then you have a 7/7 flying lifelink on the field, and an additional 14 cards in hand. If that ends up working, you've probably got a decent chance of winning the game.</p>\n<p>The deck is more expensive than Affinity, mostly due to the dual lands. I already had a Badlands, though, and I realized that I could get the deck for much cheaper if I borrowed or traded for a few of the cards and replaced some others with ones I already owned.</p>\n<p>As of now, I have all of the cards in the deck available to me, for a fraction of the price, and will go up to Worcester two weeks from now to participate in my first major tournament. See you next time!</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-87cff93934948ef30166557bd8c47a4f--","value":"<hr>\n<p>Hi again, everyone! So today, a very expensive piece of paper arrived in the mail - A Badlands from the Magic: The Gathering set Revised.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/a-nerds-word/Badlands.jpg\" alt=\"My new (used) Badlands\" title=\"My new (used) Revised Badlands.\"></p>\n<p>For those of you who don't know, Magic sets are released every few months, with the first, Alpha, having been released on August 5, 1993. The set this particular card comes from, Revised, was released less than a year afterwards, in April 1994. There were an lot of really good cards in those sets, as well as a lot of pretty bad ones. What makes some of these cards so expensive, though, is that they're part of the <a href=\"https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/official-reprint-policy-2010-03-10\">reserved list</a>. What this means is that, for legal reasons created after an outcry by collectors, every card on the list can never be reprinted in paper form.</p>\n<p>Due to supply and demand, the cards on that list, especially the good ones, are very expensive, and will continue to go up in price for the forseeable future. Which brings me back to my Badlands. Badlands is a land that lets you produce mana, which in Magic allows you to cast spells and activate abilities. These spells and abilities are essential to playing the game. They usually cost specific combinations of mana in any of the five colors (White, Blue, Black, Red, and Green), to cast, meaning you'll need to produce mana of these colors in order to cast them. Most lands can only be used (tapped) for one color; these are called basics. Many others tap for more than one color, but these have downsides; for example, shocklands, which are considered fairly strong cards, cause you to lose two life when they enter untapped; otherwise, they enter tapped. You can only use lands for mana when they're untapped, so that's pretty relevant.</p>\n<p>The one exception to this rule are dual lands. These lands, only printed in a few of the earliest sets of Magic, before the reserved list was created (Alpha, Beta, Unlimited, and Revised), tap for one of two colors upon entering untapped, with zero downside. This may not seem that strong, but it essentially makes them the best lands that tap for two colors in existence. Add in the fact that they're all on the reserved list, but can still be played in competitive formats, and that makes them very expensive. I bought my Badlands on Ebay for $166; the median price at TCGPlayer.com (one of the go-to websites for Magic: The Gathering card pricing) as of this afternoon was $312.79, so I got mine for quite a steal.</p>\n<p>Since these cards are in high demand but perpetually short supply, due to the reserved list, most Magic players agree that their price will continue to go up for the forseeable future. For me, this was a good investment, since over time, the card will continue to increase in value. In the meantime, I will run it in one of my favorite Commander decks, a vampire tribal deck with Edgar Markov as the commander. To learn more about what commander is (it's my favorite format of Magic to play), read this <a href=\"https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/ways-play/introduction-commander-2016-10-28\">article</a>. I'll make a blog post about my Edgar deck sometime next week, along with the decklist, so stay tuned if you want to know more.</p>\n<p>That's all for now! See you soon :)</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-eab7a5f5322e3e85c0e3907ace19d2b5--","value":"<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/a-nerds-word/the_fifth_season.jpg\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"The Fifth Season\"></p>\n<p>I've read a lot of science fiction and fantasy novels over the years, too many to go through in one post. So I'm going to start with the most recent one I really enjoyed, and go back from there.</p>\n<p>The Broken Earth trilogy starts with <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00H25FCSQ/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&#x26;btkr=1\">The Fifth Season</a>, by N. K. Jemisin. All three books in the trilogy won the Hugo Award (the highest honor in science fiction literature, for those of you who don't know) for best novel for their respective years of publication, and for me, at least, those awards were well deserved.</p>\n<p>The raw emotions in the series are incredibly intense, and I have to say, these books are not for the faint of heart. A lot of terrible things happen to the main characters, so if you're looking for a cheery set of books, look elsewhere.</p>\n<p>However, if you're looking for a <em>good</em> set of books, pick these up. The worldbuilding alone is excellent, and so is everything else.</p>\n<p>The trilogy takes place on an earth-like planet called The Stillness, in which for thousands of years, major earthquakes have distrupted the progress of civilization, causing what is known as a Fifth Season every few decades. These seasons are devastating, wiping out whole communities and making survival difficult at best - not unlike the classic example of a nuclear winter, except caused by earthquake-induced ash clouds and acid rain instead.</p>\n<p>One of the only reasons humanity has survived for so long in this kind of situation is the existance of people called orogenes. Orogenes have the ability to draw in  ambient energy to control the earth. In doing so, they create a torus, an area around them which usually becomes very cold, very fast due to the sudden lack of heat. They're universally hated by most people, mainly because they can just as easily cause an earthquake as stop one.</p>\n<p>In order to keep the peace, orogenes are rounded up and taken to The Fulcrum, where they act as what could be considered well-treated slaves who are sent out to try and prevent Fifth Seasons, and to stop any other earth-related problems around the Stillness.</p>\n<p>There's much more to the plot than that, and there's a lot I can't cover, including about the main character, due to spoilers.</p>\n<p>The writing in these books is sublime, but also surprisingly unique. The books take place in the present tense, which is rare enough as it is, but they also employ the first, second, and third person voices at various points. This is something I've almost never seen before, and yet Jemisin does it masterfully. It's a breath of fresh air from the regular style of writing you often see in fantasy.</p>\n<p>Anyway, that's my book review for today. I hope you enjoyed it, and see you next time!</p>\n<p><em>Edit: Corrected on 08/21/2018 - This post previously stated that only the first book in the trilogy recieved the Hugo award for best novel; in fact, all three novels in the trilogy won best novel for their respective years of publication.</em></p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-128746d5ec5555f14737f152140216b9--","value":"<hr>\n<p>Hi!

I know it's been a while since I last posted. I've been super busy with work, for the most part, but I've also been working on a couple of other side projects, which I'd like to make a bit of an announcement here about. First, my debut novel has been sent out to my second round of beta readers, and I'm hoping to send it to publishers within the next few months.</p>\n<p>On top of that, I started work on my second novel at the end of September, and I finished the first draft a couple of days ago! I'm really pysched about it, and it's certainly been keeping me busy on my commute to work :)</p>\n<p>Anyway, today's blog post is about a cyberpunk dystopian anime called Psycho Pass. It's fairly well known in the anime community, but I only got around to watching it over the last few weeks.</p>\n<p>The basic premise is that, in the 2100s, the world is ruled by an overseeing body called the Sibyl System. Every person's brain is contantly scanned for their Psycho Pass, which is a score that determines how likely you are to commit a crime in the future. The Sibyl system also judges what profession a person will take up after graduating high school, as well as a myriad of other decisions, leaving a kind of utopia of luxury where the citizens don't have anything to worry about.</p>\n<p>Of course, like most of these shows, things aren't as great as they seem. There are still crimes that occur, and people who are determined by Sibyl to be latent criminals are brutally imprisoned or murdered by the police, lest they commit actual crimes in the future. The show mainly follows Akane Tsunemori, a fresh-faced police officer who doesn't quite approve of how things are done.

Thanks so much for all your support, and I hope you continue to enjy my work!</p>\n<p>The latest installment of the <em>Dresden Files</em> by Jim Butcher, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SZLRHMT\"><em>Peace Talks</em></a>, was filled with the normal humor, action, fantastical lore, and gritty nail-baiting tension that the series is known for. It was an enjoyable, fast-paced read. But it also felt like the book served as a revolving door of cameos from the long list of cast members from the series. It was fun to see them all again, but most of the encounters were brief. So much so, in fact, that the encounters began to feel a bit forced at times, and detracted from the overall pull of the plot. I'd still recommend it as a fan of the series, but fair warning: it does very much end in a cliffhanger, so be prepared to wait for the next book to continue the story!</p>\n<p>As for the Brandon Sanderson <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6HOdHEeosc\">lectures</a>, I've watched a few of them, and they're highly enjoyable! He's got a really great way of engaging with the audience and making them feel at home. For example, a quote from the first lecture: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>If your goal isn't to become a professional writer, but you like writing, you are welcome here. If you've never written anything in your life, you are welcome here. If you thought you signed up for Chem 107 and came in here and thought \"oh god I'm surrounded by nerds\" you are welcome here!</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you have any desire to write or just want to hear from a successful author, I'd highly recommend its stuff!</p>\n<p>Finally, I've made a previous post on N.K. Jemisin's <em>Broken Earth</em> trilogy <a href=\"http://www.a-nerds-word.com/broken-earth\">which you can read here</a>, and I'll soon be making another post about her recent book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/City-We-Became-N-Jemisin-ebook/dp/B07MFKQDJM\"><em>The City We Became</em></a>. The hook from the Amazon page: <strong>Every great city has a soul. Some are ancient as myths, and others are as new and destructive as children. New York? She's got six.</strong> I haven't reading finished the book yet, but I've really been loving the story, characters, and world. Plus, as a native New Yorker, it definitely hits the spot! I'll be posting a review for it at some point soon, so stay tuned, and stay safe!</p>\n<p>Until next time,</p>\n<p>-- Bradley</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-ast-0bb8c22d1cdcdf1b4a771613d44b94c8--","value":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"yaml","value":"path: \"/long-awaited-updates-part-2\"\ndate: \"2020-08-16T13:00:00.962Z\"\ntitle: \"Long Awaited Updates Part 2: Unbounded, Peace Talks, Brandon Sanderson, and The City We Became\"\ntags: [\"Life\", \"Book Review\", \"Personal\", \"Writing\"]","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":6,"column":4,"offset":234},"indent":[1,1,1,1,1]}},{"type":"thematicBreak","position":{"start":{"line":6,"column":4,"offset":234},"end":{"line":6,"column":7,"offset":237},"indent":[]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"image","title":"Peace Talks, by Jim Butcher","url":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91GopjssTaL.jpg","alt":"alt text","position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1,"offset":238},"end":{"line":7,"column":108,"offset":345},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1,"offset":238},"end":{"line":7,"column":108,"offset":345},"indent":[]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"It took a bit longer than I'd hoped, but I'm back again!

Let's just say it involves a theoretical physics concept popular in science fiction). When a city is born, it usually turns a person who embodies the city into its immortal, human avatar. New York, though, gets <em>6</em> - one for each borough and a primary avatar. Unfortunately for them, there isn't a rulebook that comes with being an avatar of the Big Apple, and an ancient entity known as the Advesary is rather eager to take advantage of the avatars' initial weekness to, you know, casually erase the concept of NYC from reality. No big deal. The book is a great read, with a wonderfully diverse cast, an epic scale that is slowly revealed over time, and wondeful pacing, imagery, and thought put into every word.

Let's just say it involves a theoretical physics concept popular in science fiction). When a city is born, it usually turns a single person who embodies the city into its immortal, human avatar. New York, though, gets <em>6</em> - one for each borough and a primary avatar. Unfortunately for them, there isn't a rulebook that comes with being an avatar of the Big Apple, and an ancient entity known as the Adversary is rather eager to take advantage of the avatars' initial weakness to, you know, casually erase the concept of NYC from reality. No big deal. The book is a great read, with a wonderfully diverse cast, an epic scale that is slowly revealed over time, and wondeful pacing, imagery, and thought put into every word. And as a native New Yorker, it definitely hits the spot :)</p>\n<p>In other book-related news, I'm currently reading Brandon Sanderson's newest book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0826NKZHR/\"><em>Rhythm of War (The Stormlight Archive Book 4)</em></a>.
