Let's just say it involves a theoretical physics concept popular in science fiction). When a city is born, it usually turns a person who embodies the city into its immortal, human avatar. New York, though, gets <em>6</em> - one for each borough and a primary avatar. Unfortunately for them, there isn't a rulebook that comes with being an avatar of the Big Apple, and an ancient entity known as the Advesary is rather eager to take advantage of the avatars' initial weekness to, you know, casually erase the concept of NYC from reality.
