So today, I decided to make my entrance into a new format of Magic for me: Legacy.</p>\n<p>Legacy is a sixty-card Magic format that lies on the scale of expensive decks between Modern and Vintage. Modern includes cards from <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/formats/modern">this</a> list of sets - from Mirrodin to the current set. Because of this wider selection of cards available, modern is a lot more expensive than standard, which is only the last few most recent sets. <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/formats/legacy">Legacy</a>, on the other hand, has every card in Magic available, with a banlist of cards that aren\'t allowed. This means that you can play cards that are much older and more expensive; for example, the dual lands I mentioned in my last post. <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/formats/vintage">Vintage</a>, finally, has every card available, and no banlist, except for a few cards that are restricted - you can only run one of each in a deck instead of the usual four.</p>\n<p>Now, I\'ve been looking into getting into a more competitive format for a while. At first, I looked at modern, and had a lot of fun with a proxied <a href="https://www.mtggoldfish.com/archetype/modern-affinity-46460#paper">affinity</a> deck. The problem, though, was that the deck costs roughly $1000, with the downside that the cards can be reprinted; they\'re not on the reserved list.</p>\n<p>Last night, I was looking at events coming up that I could play a modern deck at and meet up with some of my friends from college. We noticed that there was an <a href="http://www.starcitygames.com/events/140718_worcester_fact_sheet.html">event</a> in Worcester, MA in two weeks. This was both nearby several of my friends, and had the added benefit of being a team format - each team of three has a standard, a modern, and a legacy player. One of my friends wanted to play modern, the other wanted to play standard. I also wanted to play modern, so we considered asking some more of our friends to start another team. But then I started looking at legacy decks and found reanimator.</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/testing-legacy-b-r-reanimator/">Reanimator</a> is a legacy deck that wins by putting a <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=239995">Griselbrand</a> into your graveyard, and then reanimating it onto the battlefield turn one. Then you have a 7/7 flying lifelink on the field, and an additional 14 cards in hand. If that ends up working, you\'ve probably got a decent chance of winning the game.</p>\n<p>The deck is more expensive than Affinity, mostly due to the dual lands. I already had a Badlands, though, and I realized that I could get the deck for much cheaper if I borrowed or traded for a few of the cards and replaced some others with ones I already owned.</p>\n<p>As of now, I have all of the cards in the deck available to me, for a fraction of the price, and will go up to Worcester two weeks from now to participate in my first major tournament. See you next time!</p>',frontmatter:{date:"July 01, 2018",path:"/reanimator",title:"Reanimator",tags:["Magic: The Gathering","Format Review","Deck Review","Life","Personal"]}}},pathContext:{}}}});
